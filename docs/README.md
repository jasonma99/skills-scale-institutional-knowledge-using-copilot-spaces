# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This repository centralizes OctoAcme’s project management processes, giving every team member equal access to core workflows, decisions, and quality standards.

## Overview of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management approach blends structure with flexibility to deliver cross-functional initiatives efficiently. Projects begin with a rigorous initiation phase: business needs are assessed, stakeholders aligned, and clear success metrics defined using a one-pager template. Planning breaks goals down into actionable backlogs, milestones, and risk registers for transparent delivery.

Roles are clearly defined for high accountability and collaboration—Project Managers (PMs) coordinate schedules, risks, and documentation; Product Managers (PdMs) clarify objectives and prioritize work; Developers implement solutions and participate in code review; QA specialists validate deliverables; and stakeholders are kept informed at every step. Communication is a core strength: daily standups, weekly syncs, stakeholder updates, and demos ensure progress, proactive escalation, and continuous alignment.

Quality practices are embedded throughout. New logic is tested with unit and integration tests, CI pipelines enforce automated checks, and releases are always preceded by smoke tests and security scans. Post-project retrospectives capture lessons, with improvements tracked and institutionalized for future cycles, driving continuous improvement as OctoAcme scales.
